# cs285-fa22-coursedb

This is an example from CS 285 from the Fall 2022 semester to build a course database for Android.

Please note that for the sake of getting through the example during the scheduled class time, some "shortcuts" are taken that should be completed when building an app intended for production, as described in the lecture.
